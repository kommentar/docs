# What is Kommentar?

Kommentar is a lightweight application that allows you to add comments to your website with ease.

## Integrating Kommentar

:::note
For now, Kommentar is only the API needed to make comments work. SDKs and unstyled components are coming soon!
:::

Since Kommentar is exposed as an HTTP API, you can integrate it into your website/app using any programming language or framework of your choice.

The API reference can be found [here](/reference/04-http-api).

## The people behind Kommentar

As of now, Kommentar is a solo project by me, [@safwanyp](https://github.com/safwanyp).

## Motivation

I have a very simple website at [safwanyp.com](https://safwanyp.com). I try and write about things that I find interesting, or about something I learned that I think is worth sharing.

I wanted to add comments to my website, but I didn't want to use any of the existing solutions out there. I wanted something that is simple, easy to use, and doesn't require me to sign up for anything.

So I decided to build Kommentar. A simple solution that would allow me to add comments to my site without any hassle. It also was an opportunity for me to put my newly acquired knowledge about the Ports and Adapters pattern into practice.

I hope you find it useful!
