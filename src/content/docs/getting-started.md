# What is Kommentar?

Kommentar is a lightweight application that allows you to add comments to your website with ease.

## Quick Start

:::note
For now, Kommentar is only the API needed to make comments work. SDKs and unstyled components are coming soon!

## Integrating Kommentar

Since Kommentar is exposed as an HTTP API, you can integrate it into your website/app using any programming language or framework of your choice.

The API reference can be found [here](/docs/reference/03-api-reference).
