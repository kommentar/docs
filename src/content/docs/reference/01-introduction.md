The API exposes a couple of endpoints for the different entities in Kommentar. Read more about these endpoints in the [HTTP API](/reference/04-http-api) section.

The application code adheres to the Ports and Adapters pattern.
The reason for this is to make it easier to enable different technologies with no changes to the core application logic.

As somewhat of a bonus, I have come to like this pattern quite a bit. I'm still learning so it won't be perfect, but it gets the job done!
