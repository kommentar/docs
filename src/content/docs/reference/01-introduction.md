The API exposes a couple of endpoints for the different entities in Kommentar. Read more about these endpoints in the [HTTP API](/docs/reference/04-http-api) section.

The application code adheres to the Ports and Adapters pattern, along with Command-Query Responsibility segregation.
It might seem overkill, but this helps in modifying the app to use whatever technologies you want with minimal effort.

As somewhat of a bonus, I have come to like this pattern quite a bit. I'm still learning so it won't be perfect, but it gets the job done!
