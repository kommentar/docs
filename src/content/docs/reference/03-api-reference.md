title: API Reference (HTTP)
description: HTTP API reference for Kommentar
---

Kommentar exposes a simple HTTP API.

- OpenAPI Specification: https://kommentar.safwanyp.com/spec
- API Reference (UI): https://kommentar.safwanyp.com/reference

To ensure consistency, I will not document the API here. Please use one of the above links to explore the API. I have tried to make it as detailed as possbile, including request and response examples, as well as error codes.

You might wonder why there are just 4 endpoints, and that wonder is valid. I plan to add more endpoints soon for some management features, such as (but not limited to):

- Fetching comments by a specific commenter
- Fetching comments by a specific session
- Fetching a list of all hosts
